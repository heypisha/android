PHASE 1 — Skeleton Project
	🎯 Goal: App runs, navigation works, all required screens exist with placeholder content.

Project Initialization
	 Create new Android Studio project
	 Use Empty Compose Activity
	 Kotlin + Compose enabled
	 Correct package name (seneca.pmugisha3.cosmotracker)
	 App launches successfully on emulator/device

Dependencies & Tooling (Minimal, Skeleton-Only)
	 Configure Compose BOM
	 Add Navigation Compose dependency
	 Add Lifecycle ViewModel Compose dependency
	 Confirm project syncs successfully

	Ignore dependency analyzer warnings for now (intentionally deferred)

🚫 Do NOT add yet:
	Retrofit
	Room
	Firebase
	Location services
	Coil
	KSP / Google Services plugin

Navigation Setup (Core Skeleton)
	Create ui/navigation package
	Create NavGraph.kt
	Add NavHost
	Define NavController using rememberNavController()
	Set start destination
	Verify app shows initial screen via NavHost

Route Modeling
	Create sealed class for routes:
		Home
		Events
		Event Details (with placeholder arguments)
		Favourites
		Hazard Near Me
	 Confirm navigation between all screens works

Screen Creation (Placeholders Only)
	🎯 No logic, no ViewModels, no data

	Create one composable per screen, with minimal content.

	Each screen should include:
		○ A title (e.g. Text("Home Screen"))
		○ Optional subtitle (e.g. Text("APOD will be displayed here"))

	Required Screens:
	HomeScreen
	EventsScreen
	EventDetailScreen
	FavouritesScreen
	HazardNearMeScreen

Navigation Wiring
	Connect each route to its screen composable
	Add basic navigation actions (buttons or clicks)
	Confirm navigation between all screens works
	Verify back navigation works correctly

App-Level UI Structure
	Wrap app in Scaffold
	Add TopAppBar (title only)
	Optional: BottomNavigation (even if buttons don’t do much yet)
	Confirm navigation still works inside the scaffold

	🚫 Do NOT add yet:
	Animations
	Theming polish
	Icons
	State management

Basic Project Structure
	Set up folders early (even if empty):
	 ui/screens/
	 ui/navigation/
	 ui/components/
	 viewmodel/
	 data/
	 data/remote/
	 data/local/
	 repository/

Skeleton Milestone Validation
	Before moving on, confirm:
	App builds with no errors
	You can navigate to every screen
	Every screen displays placeholder content
	No business logic yet
	Code is committed to GitHub (skeleton-navigation commit)
		○ Commit message: feat: navigation skeleton & placeholder screens

PHASE 2 — Remote Data (NASA APIs)

	🎯 Goal: Fetch and display real data.

	 Add Retrofit & OkHttp dependencies
	Add Moshi
	Create API service interfaces
	Create data models (DTOs)
	Implement repository layer
	Add ViewModels for Home & Events
	Display APOD image on Home screen
	Display EONET events list

PHASE 3 — Local Data & Persistence

	🎯 Goal: Save and retrieve user data.

	Add Room dependencies (with BOM)
	Enable KSP
	Create Room entities
	Create DAO interfaces
	Implement local repository
	Add favourites functionality

PHASE 4 — Firebase Integration

	🎯 Goal: Sync favourites across sessions/devices.

	Add Firebase BOM
	Configure Firebase project
	Connect Firestore
	Sync favourites to cloud
	Handle basic error states

PHASE 5 — Location-Based Feature

	🎯 Goal: Show hazards near the user.

	Add Location Services dependency
	Request runtime permissions
	Fetch user location
	Filter hazard events by proximity
	Display results on Hazard Near Me screen

PHASE 6 — Polish & Submission

	🎯 Goal: Submission-ready app.

	UI polish (spacing, typography)
	Loading states
	Error handling
	Edge-case testing
	Record demo video
	Final README update
